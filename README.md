# Country Tour using React

This is just a Practice Project where I used React to fetch data from api and made functional cards using that fetched data.

### Covered Topics

- **React Components**: Made functional and re-useable UI Components.
- **Props**: Passed data from one component to another using props.
- **useState**: Managed components using useState.
- **useEffect (hook)**: Used useEffect to fetch data from API.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displayed different UI based on component state
